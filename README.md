# ViraML

ViraML is a cry*** project designed to create a L2 on e*\**reum that performs inference on machine learning model. 
The key concept is model paritioning to reduce the size of the models, and concurrent verification from 
validators, ensuring a scalable and secure solution to Machine Learning on Cha\**. 

# Integrate your De** applications with ML

While we work on the platform and the tech this readme will be updated as it comes.
